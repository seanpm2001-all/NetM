# Plans

## 2021 October 6th

### NetV

NetV is an alternative to the WebM video format by Google. This format will be more open, and will retain complete backwards compatibility with the WebM format.

Its name stands for Network Video, while the WebM format stands for Web Media/Web Movie.

## The name is important

The unique names of the original file extensions are important, and I made sure to retain that in this format set. That is why I named the formats so similarly (Net is an alternative word for Web)

### NetP

NetP is an alternative to the WebP video format by Google. This format will be more open, and will retain complete backwards compatibility with the WebP format.

Its name stands for Network Picture, while the WebP format stands for Web Picture.

### Browser extension

This project will also contain its own browser extension for exporting WebM and WebP files on the Internet to a more friendly format, such as NetM, NetP, JPG, PNG, MP4, or SVG.

### NetM

NetM (Net Media) is the main repository that contains the tools for this set of formats, such as a media player, a media converter, a browser extension, and documentation related to the 2 codecs.
